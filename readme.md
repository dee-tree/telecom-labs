1. Lab 1:
    * [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/dee-tree/telecom-labs/blob/master/labs/lab1/lab1.ipynb)
    * [Local Jupyter notebook](./labs/lab1/lab1.ipynb)


### Note:

* Lab notebooks use module `install_deps.py`, which is in `labs` folder.
`install_deps.require_think_dsp()` is used to provide `thinkdsp` module in case of lack it. You can run the code both on 
Windows and linux OS. For Windows OS local version of `wget.exe` is used.

* If you just want to *see* the code, you can open local **.ipynb** versions of notebooks or use Google Colab references.

* If your purpose is to *run and change* the code, you can clone/download the repo and execute the code using Jupyter Notebook or PyCharm Professional.
